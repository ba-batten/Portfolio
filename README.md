# Portfolio
This is my portfolio that will be published to [brandonbatten.com](www.brandonbatten.com).  

## Features
* About section with a description of myself, a skills list, and a link to my new blog
* Portfolio section highlighting work I have done to date.  I will be adding projects to this list as they are completed.  Some upcoming projects are a website for a local Mexican restaurant, an auto detailing business, and a church.
* Contact information
* Links to some of my favorite development websites and references
* A live demo of the Arcade Clone project I completed as part of my Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree through Udacity

## Future additions
* API calls to Blogger to display my blog entries directly on my portfolio page
* Change display style of portfolio works to just be a thumbnail that displays information about each project when the user's mouse hovers over the item.
* Use a chart to display skills and competency levels for each skill
